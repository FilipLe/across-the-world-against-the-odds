If it were not for her, our lives would not be what they are today. I wanted to write this book to ensure that her story, her sacrifices, and her strength are never forgotten. It is not every day that a woman walks through fire and walks out carrying her children—and her future—on her back. It would be a waste to let her story go untold.</p>

                <p className = "indent">On 1/6/1949, in the rural province of Thanh Hoá, Vietnam was born my grandmother, Nguyễn Thị Thoa—or at least, that was the date many years later recorded on her birth certificate, hastily created when she needed one to begin elementary school. In truth, her mother, like many others in the village at the time, was illiterate and could not read a calendar—only recalling that her daughter was born in the year of the Buffalo. Life was not romantic—it was survival dressed in the thinnest linen. She was the youngest of the nine children, born into a childhood shaped by war, scarcity, and the enduring strength of a close-knit community.</p>
                <p className = "indent">The Vietnam War broke out in the mid-1950s, a brutal conflict between the communist North and the US-backed anti-communist South. Thanh Hoá, located just in the center of Vietnam, became a strategically important region — the one connecting the two regions and ultimately enabling a supply route and a military stronghold for the Viet Congs fighting in South Vietnam. Hence, due to having key infrastructure like the Hàm</p>

                <p className = "indent">But even then, my grandmother’s education did not unfold in a classroom. It took place in a bunker beneath the ground that she and her classmates had dug with their own hands. Together, they huddled underground, whispering conjugations as B-52 bombers rumbled overhead. No matter the hour or lesson, one student was always stationed at the entrance—on guard, eyes sharp, a stick or rusted blade in hand—ready to alert the others at the first sign of danger. They rotated in silence, a shifting roster of children learning and watching, watching and learning, their childhood measured not by bells, but by bombs.</p>

                <p>communist period, poverty was not just widespread—it was systemized. With no free market, there was no way to earn more, save more, or build a better life through individual effort. My grandmother was the youngest of nine, born into a family that survived on resourcefulness and grit. Her parents, though unable to read or write, were masterful in the art of making. Her father built the family’s beds, roofs, and farming tools with bare hands and scrap wood, metal, and whatever the land offered. Her mother farmed rice, fermented fish sauce, and dried what little they caught to stretch each meal across the week. What you ate or used, you had to produce yourself.</p>

What little they grew, caught, or made, they were obligated to surrender to share with the state. Every grain of rice was fought for. The family’s most valuable asset was not jewelry or land, but a single buffalo for its ability to pull the plow and bring life from the soil. One day, word spread that officials were coming</p>

                <p className = "indent">Getting to Hanoi was another matter. The country was still in the throes of war. To reach Hanoi from Thanh Hóa, she had to travel at night, hidden in pig-transportation trucks to avoid detection from American bombers. The menacing B52s would strike anything that moved by day. Her mother had packed sticky rice balls (nắm cơm) for the journey, tucking them carefully into a cloth bundle. But my grandmother was small and slight, and as she strained to hoist herself into the back of the truck—gripping the wooden frame, her legs barely reaching the edge—the bundle slipped from her hands and fell to the ground. She had no time to retrieve it. The truck was already pulling away. So she rode hungry, her stomach empty, her hands clinging to the crate as the wheels carried her deeper into the night.</p>
                <p className = "indent">The journey was long, anxious, and uncertain. They slept during the day in strangers’ homes, hiding among villagers, sometimes without food.

                <p>and the engine would sputter like an old man trying to breathe. The truck bumped along broken roads, its wheels grinding over gravel and cratered earth left behind by bombs. Nights passed in silence. Time blurred. Each village looked like the last—dark, quiet, half-empty. They switched trucks more than once, ducking under tarps, sometimes sharing space with livestock. And then, finally, the skyline changed. She had arrived — Hanoi.</p>
                <p className = "indent">Once in Hanoi, she learned that she had been awarded a scholarship to study Chemistry in Kraków, Poland. The government assigned the smartest students across the nation to fields they deemed necessary for the country’s progress. Chemistry, it would be. She didn’t question it. She had grown used to obeying orders larger than herself. At 18, she weighed just 36 kilograms. A small girl with a large dream she never asked for.</p>

The air inside the compartments was stale, heavy with the scent of wool and metal. Meals were handed out occasionally, but nothing looked or tasted familiar. Once, they were served bread and cottage cheese—soft, white, strange. One boy shouted, “Tụi nó cho mình ăn vôi kìa!” —“They’re feeding us construction hydrated lime!” The entire group fell silent.</p>
