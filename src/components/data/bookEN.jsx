In truth, her mother, like many others in the village at the time, was illiterate and could not read a calendar—only recalling that her daughter was born in the year of the Buffalo. Life was not romantic—it was survival dressed in the thinnest linen. She was the youngest of the nine children, born into a childhood shaped by war, scarcity, and the enduring strength of a close-knit community.</p>
                <p className = "indent">The Vietnam War broke out in the mid-1950s, a brutal conflict between the communist North and the US-backed anti-communist South. Thanh Hoá, located just in the center of Vietnam, became a strategically important region — the one connecting the two regions and ultimately enabling a supply route and a military stronghold for the Viet Congs fighting in South Vietnam. Hence, due to having key infrastructure like the Hàm</p>

They rotated in silence, a shifting roster of children learning and watching, watching and learning, their childhood measured not by bells, but by bombs.</p>

With no free market, there was no way to earn more, save more, or build a better life through individual effort. My grandmother was the youngest of nine, born into a family that survived on resourcefulness and grit. Her parents, though unable to read or write, were masterful in the art of making. Her father built the family’s beds, roofs, and farming tools with bare hands and scrap wood, metal, and whatever the land offered. Her mother farmed rice, fermented fish sauce, and dried what little they caught to stretch each meal across the week. What you ate or used, you had to produce yourself.</p>

To reach Hanoi from Thanh Hóa, she had to travel at night, hidden in pig-transportation trucks to avoid detection from American bombers. The menacing B52s would strike anything that moved by day. Her mother had packed sticky rice balls (nắm cơm) for the journey, tucking them carefully into a cloth bundle. But my grandmother was small and slight, and as she strained to hoist herself into the back of the truck—gripping the wooden frame, her legs barely reaching the edge—the bundle slipped from her hands and fell to the ground. She had no time to retrieve it. The truck was already pulling away. So she rode hungry, her stomach empty, her hands clinging to the crate as the wheels carried her deeper into the night.</p>

Nights passed in silence. Time blurred. Each village looked like the last—dark, quiet, half-empty. They switched trucks more than once, ducking under tarps, sometimes sharing space with livestock. And then, finally, the skyline changed. She had arrived — Hanoi.</p>

The government assigned the smartest students across the nation to fields they deemed necessary for the country’s progress. Chemistry, it would be. She didn’t question it.

Once, they were served bread and cottage cheese—soft, white, strange.
